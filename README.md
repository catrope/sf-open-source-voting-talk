# San Francisco Open Source Voting Talk

This repository contains the slides for a 20-minute talk I gave on San
Francisco's Open Source Voting System project.

The raw file is in Markdown.  The Markdown file can be converted to PDF
slides using the open-source program called
[Marp](https://yhatt.github.io/marp/) (Markdown Presentation Writer),
which is a desktop application for Mac OS X.
