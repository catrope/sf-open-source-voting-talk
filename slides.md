# What is a voting system?

## (Assume paper-ballot optical scan)

## Hardware

* Accessible voting device
* Precinct ballot scanner
* Central ballot scanner (for vote-by-mail)

---
# What is a voting system?

## Software

* Central storage (e.g. database)
* Ballot layout
* Ballot adjudication (e.g. write-ins)
* Tabulation
* Results Reporting
* Etc.

---
# Problems with voting systems today

## 1. Systems are expensive

* $22 million for SF from 2008 to 2018
  * $10 million up-front + $1 million / year
* Equipment same as 10 years ago
* $450 million proposed bond measure in CA
  * $600-675 million including county funds

---
# Problems with voting systems today

## 2. Systems not transparent
* Source code secret

## 3. Systems lack features
* One example: better auditing
* Can't make even simple changes
* No ability to experiment / innovate / improve

---
# Problems with voting systems today

## 4. Not many options
* 3 major vendors
* Hard for new entrants to break in

## 5. Vendor lock-in
* Only one company can service / support
* Replacing often requires totally new system

---
# Solution

## Make voting systems a part of our public infrastructure.
* Shared public resource rather than commercial product

---
# What is open source software?

## Technical definition: Software with an "OSI‑approved" software license.

## Two examples
* Firefox browser
* Linux operating system

---
# What is open source software?

## Non-technical definition: Anyone can—

1. **View** the code for free
2. **Use** the code for free
3. Copy and **change** the code for free

## Even better is a "copyleft" license like GPL

* Changed copies must also have the **same** license
* Means later versions "stay" open source

---
# Don't just want open source software

* Hardware should be **easily available & affordable**

  * E.g. Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS)

* Supporting materials should be **openly licensed**

  * Design documents
  * User manuals
  * Test scripts
  * Etc.
